# Instaframe

Currently, this app takes photos from the Viget Instagram account and displays them as a photo album. Future releases should add the ability to authenticate locally for a more personalized album.

### Build it

`npm install -d`

### Test it

`npm test`

### Start it

`npm start`

---

### Roadmap

Currently we're generating `myfeed` calls in `Instagrammar` using a manually harvested auth token. I'd love to see the some sort of clientside badge that does this for us.
